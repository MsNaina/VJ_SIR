                As outlined in our Terms of Use, you must meet specific age
                requirements to register and use our Services. Individuals who
                are minors (i.e., under the age of 18), un-discharged
                insolvents, etc., are not eligible to register for the Services.
                If you are a minor and wish to use our Services, your legal
                guardian or parents must agree to the Terms of Use and this
                Privacy Policy on your behalf. If a minor uses the Services, it
                is assumed that they have obtained consent from their legal
                guardian or parents. We are not responsible for any consequences
                arising from misuse by minors registering for our Services.
              </p>
              <p>
                By using the Services, you confirm that all the data you provide
                is accurate and complete and that minors using the Services have
                obtained the necessary consent from their parents or legal
                guardians. We reserve the right to terminate access to the
                Services if we discover that a user is under 18 and has not
                obtained the required consent, or if any information provided is
                inaccurate.
